Geometry! We all remember this from school: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Any two points determine a unique line.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any two lines intersect in at most one point.
    </li>
</ol>
By <em>line</em> here we are thinking of a straight line.
Obviously things are going to be more complicated if we allow
the lines to wiggle around.

<p>
There's plenty of ways to monkey around with axioms for geometry.
In particular, if it weren't for parallel lines we would have
a theory that treated lines and points the same way:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Any two points determine a unique line.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any two lines determine a unique point.
    </li>
</ol>
This is called <em>projective</em> geometry:
we added some more points at infinity so that those
parallel lines have somewhere to meet.

<p>
Now that we have some axioms, we can try drawing some
models that satisfy those axioms.
Because we want to keep things simple, we can try
looking for models with only a finite number of
lines and points.
<p>

<p>
Here is a good example of a finite projective
geometry:
</p>
    <p align="center"><canvas id='canvas-fano' width='600' height='300'> Canvas Fail </canvas> </p>
<p>
This is called the Fano plane, it has seven points and seven lines.
There's a wonky looking line that looks like a circle, but we need this
guy to satisfy our axioms. 
And you should check the axioms yourself: 
for any two points there is a unique line (going through them),
and for any two lines
there is a unique point (where they intersect).
</p>

<p>
This is a schematic diagram: even though I drew blue lines
and lines have infinitely many points on them, each of these lines only
has three points.

<p>
You may be used to thinking of lines and points and intersections,
but recently I've been learning about a more complicated construction,
known as a <em>flag</em>.
