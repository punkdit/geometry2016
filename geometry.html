Geometry! We all remember this from school: 
<ol>
    <li>
        Any two points determine a unique line.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any two lines intersect in at most one point.
    </li>
</ol>
By <em>line</em> here we are thinking of a straight line.
Obviously things are going to be more complicated if we allow
the lines to wiggle around.

<p>
There's plenty of ways to monkey around with axioms for geometry.
In particular, if it weren't for parallel lines we would have
a theory that treated lines and points the same way:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Any two points determine a unique line.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any two lines determine a unique point.
    </li>
</ol>
This is called <em>projective</em> geometry:
we added some more points at infinity so that those
parallel lines have somewhere to meet.
<!-- There's a third axiom that we skipped, which is ... -->

<p>
Now that we have some axioms, we can try drawing some
models that satisfy those axioms.
Because we want to keep things simple, we can try
looking for models with only a finite number of
lines and points.
<p>

<p>
Here is a good example of a finite projective
geometry:
</p>
    <p align="center"><canvas id='canvas-fano' width='600' height='300'> Canvas Fail </canvas> </p>
<p>
This is called the <u>Fano plane</u>. It has seven points and seven lines.
There's a weirdo line that looks like a circle, but we need this
guy so that all the axioms are satisfied.
And you should check this yourself: 
for any two points there is a unique line (going through them),
and for any two lines
there is a unique point (where they intersect).
</p>

<p>
This is a schematic diagram: even though I drew red lines
and lines have infinitely many points on them, each of these lines only
has three points.
</p>

<p>
Just to emphasize the abstract nature of this construction, here is
another picture of the Fano plane.
Each point is represented as a green dot,
and each line is represented by a red dot.
These dots have connections that show how each point
of the Fano plane lives on three lines, and vice-versa:
</p>

    <p align="center"><canvas id='canvas-chambers' width='300' height='300'> Canvas Fail </canvas> </p>

<p>
So each one of these black connecting lines represents a relation
between a point and a line of the Fano plane.
This relation is very simple, it just states that a point
lies on a line. Or, a line contains a point.
It gets a bit clunky how english has two ways of
saying this, so we just say instead that 
a point and a line are <em>incident.</em>
</p>

    <p align="center"><canvas id='canvas-fano-chambers' width='800' height='400'> Canvas Fail </canvas> </p>

<p>
Try clicking on the geometry to see where the points and lines are in the
incidence diagram.
Click on incidence relations (the black lines) to see how these correspond to
a point and a line in the geometry.
The whole thing is highly symmetric, and you can see that most clearly from the incidence picture.
All seven lines actually "look the same", it's only when you try
to draw the geometry that one of the lines ends up looking like a circle.
</p>

<p>
Any incident pair of a point and a line we call a <em>flag</em>.
But to see why we use this name we have to bump up to one more
dimension. 
Now we have points, lines, and surfaces.
Any three of these, mutually incident, actually looks like a flag!
</p>
    <p align="center"> <canvas id='canvas-flag' width='300' height='300' tabindex='1'> Canvas Fail </canvas> </p>

<p>
Here is another kind of geometry, based on a hexagonal tiling.
Use the J,K,L keys to move the flag around.
</p>

    <p align="center"> <canvas id='canvas-thin' width='600' height='300' tabindex='1'> Canvas Fail </canvas> </p>
    <div id = "status"></div>
